<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a Research Intern at [NVIDIA Research Taiwan](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/twn/), focusing on vision-language generative models, with a recent interest in world foundation models and large reasoning models.

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), supervised by Prof. [Yu-Chiang Frank Wang](https://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/ycwang.html). Previously, I was a applied scientist intern at Microsoft, working on designing and deploying deep learning models for Bing Maps.

Prior to my Ph.D., I received my Bachelor's degree from [Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/) at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/) in 2022.
